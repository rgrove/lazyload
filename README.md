LazyLoad
========

**Note:** LazyLoad is no longer being maintained. I'm not responding to issues or pull requests, since I don't use this project anymore and don't have time to work on it. Please feel free to fork it if you want to continue development on it.

LazyLoad is a tiny (only 966 bytes minified and gzipped), dependency-free
JavaScript utility that makes it super easy to load external JavaScript and CSS
files on demand.

Whenever possible, LazyLoad will automatically load resources in parallel while
ensuring execution order when you specify an array of URLs to load. In browsers
that don't preserve the execution order of asynchronously-loaded scripts,
LazyLoad will safely load the scripts sequentially.

Use LazyLoad when you need a small, fast, safe dynamic JS or CSS loader, but
don't need the overhead of dependency management or other extra functionality
that larger script loaders provide.

Usage
-----

Using LazyLoad is simple. Just call the appropriate method -- `css()` to load
CSS, `js()` to load JavaScript -- and pass in a URL or array of URLs to load.
You can also provide a callback function if you'd like to be notified when the
resources have finished loading, as well as an argument to pass to the callback
and a context in which to execute the callback.

```js
// Load a single JavaScript file and execute a callback when it finishes.
LazyLoad.js('http://example.com/foo.js', function () {
  alert('foo.js has been loaded');
});

// Load multiple JS files and execute a callback when they've all finished.
LazyLoad.js(['foo.js', 'bar.js', 'baz.js'], function () {
  alert('all files have been loaded');
});

// Load a CSS file and pass an argument to the callback function.
LazyLoad.css('foo.css', function (arg) {
  alert(arg);
}, 'foo.css has been loaded');

// Load a CSS file and execute the callback in a different scope.
LazyLoad.css('foo.css', function () {
  alert(this.foo); // displays 'bar'
}, null, {foo: 'bar'});
```

If you need to set some attributes for resource tags you can just use objects 
instead of strings.

```js
LazyLoad.js({url: 'http://example.com/foo.js', id: 'myScript'}, function() {
  alert(document.getElementById('myScript').tagName);
});

LazyLoad.css(['foo.css', 'bar.css', {url: 'baz.css', media: 'print'}], function() {
  alert('all styles have been loaded');
});
```

Supported Browsers
------------------

  * Firefox 2+
  * Google Chrome
  * Internet Explorer 6+
  * Opera 9+
  * Safari 3+
  * Mobile Safari
  * Android

Other browsers may work, but haven't been tested. It's a safe bet that anything
based on a recent version of Gecko or WebKit will probably work.

Caveats
-------

All browsers support parallel loading of CSS. However, only Firefox and Opera
currently support parallel script loading while preserving execution order. To
ensure that scripts are always executed in the correct order, LazyLoad will load
all scripts sequentially in browsers other than Firefox and Opera. Hopefully
other browsers will improve their parallel script loading behavior soon.
